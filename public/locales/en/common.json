        "question": "What technologies power TapSwap's architecture?",
        "answer": "TapSwap is built on Next.js for server-side rendering, uses next-i18next for internationalization, and Chakra UI for responsive design. Our backend implements RESTful APIs with rate limiting and caching for optimal performance."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How does TapSwap handle code verification?",
        "answer": "We employ a multi-stage verification system: automated validation checks, rate limiting to prevent abuse, and a distributed caching layer for real-time code status updates. Each code is verified against merchant APIs where available."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What security measures are in place?",
        "answer": "TapSwap implements industry-standard security practices including HTTPS encryption, XSS protection, CSRF tokens, and rate limiting. We use secure session management and follow OWASP security guidelines."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How does the internationalization system work?",
        "answer": "Our i18n system uses next-i18next with JSON-based translation files, supporting RTL languages like Persian. We implement dynamic locale detection, fallback languages, and maintain consistent translations across all supported languages."
